## ðŸ“œ Legal Disclaimer

This project does **not collect, scrape, or retrieve data** from any external services or third-party APIs.  
All flight trajectory data visualized using this tool is either:

- Manually entered by the user, or
- Shared through a compact, non-reversible encoded string created entirely in-browser.

The application performs **all computation locally in the user's browser**, without any server-side communication or data storage.

**No third-party data sources are accessed, queried, or used without explicit user input.**  
This tool is designed solely as a visualizer and educational interface for user-provided flight trajectory data.

Use of this tool **does not violate** the terms of service of services such as FlightAware, OpenSky Network, or ADS-B Exchange, as it does **not access** or **interact** with these platforms.

If you believe that any content or functionality violates a data usage policy, please open an issue or contact the repository maintainer directly.
